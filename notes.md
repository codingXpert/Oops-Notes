## Object Oriented Programming(OOPS)
***
It is a methodology or style to develop the programs using class and objects.

### Advantages of Oops
***
1. **Modularity**: Dividing the big or large programs into smaller tasks or modules using methods.

2. **Reusability**: We can use the methods or modules anywhere in the program by calling them.

3. **Flexibility**: Enable us to easily modify , maintain and scale the the program in future.

### Features of Oops
***

```
1. Class
2. Object
3. Abstraction
4. Encapsulation
5. Inheritance
6. Polymorphism
```
**1.Class**
* Class is a user defined datatype.
* Class is a model/template/blueprint/prototype for creating object.
* Class contains data member and member 
function together.
* Class is used to represent/define the properties(variables) and behavior(function/method) of an object.
* Properties tells us which types of properties/variable the class have.
* Behavior tells us about for which purpose/operation this class is created. 
* Class is a logical entity(or we can say it is a logical thinking in general word).

* In the above image we have a class pen having some properties like color and type(prototypes).
Now this prototype is in internal mind or memory of the program and it will not come into picture until we create an actual product using this prototype and this actual product creation is done through Objects in programming.

**2.Objects**
* Object is an instance of a class.
* An Object is a physical entity which exist in the real world.
*  Each object has an identity, a behavior and a state. The state of an object is stored in fields (variables), while methods (functions) display the object's behavior. Objects are created at runtime from templates or classes. 
* **Characteristics**
a. Identification(Name of the object)
b. Properties(Variables)
c. Behavior(function/methods)

**Types OF Constructor**

```
i. Non-Parametrized Constructor
ii. Parametrized Constructor
iii. Copy Constructor
iv. Default Constructor
```

**iv> Default Constructor**

* Every java class based program has a default constructor which is automatically generated by the compiler.

* If we do not create any constructor in our program the something like this

``` java

class Student{
    int sno;
    String sname;

    Student(){     //default constructor added by the compiler
        sno = 0;
        sname = null;
    }
}

```

then compiler automatically adds a constructor.

* The purpose is to initialize the variables/instance variables with some default values provided by the compiler.

* Defaults Values:-
int - 0,
String - null,
float - 0.0,
Object - null,
