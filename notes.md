## Object Oriented Programming(OOPS)
***
It is a methodology or style to develop the programs using class and objects.

### Advantages of Oops
***
1. **Modularity**: Dividing the big or large programs into smaller tasks or modules using methods.

2. **Reusability**: We can use the methods or modules anywhere in the program by calling them.

3. **Flexibility**: Enable us to easily modify , maintain and scale the the program in future.
